# Prototype Bot

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Uh, quite simply, it's a prototype bot. It has many prefixes, like 200. See prefix.py in the code-here branch for details ðŸ˜Ž

**Bot Mechanics:**

- What's Good: Responses with a "YOOOOO WHATS GOOD {your name}"
- More coming shortly (ie. slash commands, private messages)
